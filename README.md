# pagmo2_nds_benchmarks

This repository contains the code used to extend [pagmo2](https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/) to compare non-dominated sorting algorithms in our paper about [rank-based non-dominated sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13654).

Up to date implementations of these algorithms can also be found in [operon](https://github.com/heal-research/operon).
